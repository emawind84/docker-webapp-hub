# Sample application

This is just a really simple web page to test with the hub,
follow below to run it.

Copy the file named `sample.conf` inside the `conf.d` directory,
that is located just under the root directory (NOT inside the `hub` folder).

Use docker-compose to start the web application:

    $ docker-compose up -d

If it works you should see the Nginx welcome page.
